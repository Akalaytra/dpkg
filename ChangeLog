	* : tag 1.13.22-10

	* [bootstrap-arch.diff] : Allow configure to deterimine build
	architecture if dpkg is not already installed.  It is a mystery
	how we ever got dpkg to work in the first place, but it seems we 
	have been leveraging the previous version of dpkg every time we
	build a new one.  Under mock this dependency becomes apparent.

	* [no-translation.diff] : Include Makefile.in changes along with
	Makefile.am so we don't have to rerun automake when building rpms.
